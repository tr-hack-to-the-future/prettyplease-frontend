          <p>Many companies would rather support a long term project and work sustainably towards real and tangible changes in communities. </p>
           <p>Some charities may never get a sponsor's attention because they donâ€™t have enough funds to market themselves, while sponsors may want to get the chance to support smaller initiatives or grassroots movements, rather than well known and generally well-supported charities. </p>
          <p>Pretty Please is a unique platform to connect charities and potential sponsors and manage all the process until they establish an agreement. This is just the beginning of a long term collaboration.</p>
