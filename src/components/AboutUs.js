          <p>Many  companies would rather support a long term project and work sustainably towards real and tangible changes in communities. Some charities may never get sponsors attention because they donâ€™t have enough funds to market themselves,  while sponsors may want to get the chance to support smaller initiatives or grassroots movements, rather than well known and generally well supported  charities. </p>
          <p>Pretty Please offers a secure  platform for charities to attract sponsors potentially  matching their values or checking their previous  history of supporting initiatives</p>
